# Security Checklist for Public Repository

## âœ… Completed Steps

### 1. Code Cleanup
- [x] Removed hardcoded email addresses from main.py
- [x] Removed hardcoded passwords from main.py
- [x] Replaced credentials with environment variables
- [x] Updated .gitignore to exclude sensitive files

### 2. Environment Variables Setup
- [x] Created setup_env.py script for easy .env creation
- [x] Updated main.py to use os.getenv() for all credentials
- [x] Added fallback values for environment variables

### 3. Documentation
- [x] Updated README.md with environment setup instructions
- [x] Added security notes and best practices
- [x] Created cleanup_git_history.sh script

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps (REQUIRED)

### 1. Clean Git History
```bash
# Install git-filter-repo if not already installed
pip install git-filter-repo

# Run the cleanup script
./cleanup_git_history.sh
```

### 2. Create .env File
```bash
# Run the setup script
python setup_env.py
```

### 3. Test Application
```bash
# Make sure everything works with environment variables
python main.py
```

### 4. Commit Clean Code
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Secure code with environment variables"
```

### 5. Force Push Clean History
```bash
git push origin main --force
```

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Rotate Credentials

**Before making the repository public, you MUST:**

1. **Change your Kaggle password**
2. **Change your ChatGPT password** (if you use it)
3. **Generate a new Flask secret key**
4. **Update your .env file with new credentials**

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Consider using a secrets manager for production

### Code Security
- No hardcoded credentials
- Use environment variables for all secrets
- Implement proper input validation
- Regular security audits

### Repository Security
- Keep `.env` in `.gitignore`
- Use `.env.example` for documentation
- Monitor for accidental credential commits
- Consider using pre-commit hooks

## ðŸ“‹ Final Verification

Before making public, verify:

- [ ] No credentials in current code
- [ ] No credentials in Git history
- [ ] `.env` file exists and works
- [ ] Application runs without hardcoded values
- [ ] All credentials have been rotated
- [ ] `.gitignore` properly configured

## ðŸ†˜ If Credentials Were Exposed

1. **Immediately rotate all exposed credentials**
2. **Check for unauthorized access**
3. **Monitor accounts for suspicious activity**
4. **Consider using 2FA where available**
5. **Review access logs**

**Remember: Security is an ongoing process, not a one-time task!**
